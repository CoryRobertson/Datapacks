# Datapacks
 A repo of datapacks for Minecraft 1.17.1 intended to add things I find interesting to minecraft.

### Datapacks in this repository:
- Hardcore Hearts
  - Changes how you play by removing one heart from your total health each death until you are locked to 0 hearts remaining.
  - The player can get their hearts back by surviving for at least one day, and having greater than or equal to 20 levels. This will consume their levels and give them their heart back.
- Soft Hardcore
  - Changes hardcore mode into a more forgiving yet uneasy way to play, you get 3 lives and after that you are set to spectator.
  - You can get your deaths reset as a spectator by having another player, or a dispenser drop a diamond block on the ground, then run into it while still in spectator view. This will delete the diamond block in the process and reset your lives to 3.
- Kill Border
  - Changes the world to have a world border that expands based on mob kills.
  - The amount of kills needed goes up each time it expands.
- Resonance Cascade
  - Generates dimensions using a java program that I am developing inside this repo on the side.
  - The player is teleported through each dimension till there are no more, stopping on the last one.
  - The platform the player is teleported onto is copied between each dimension.
  - The time the player takes to teleport between each dimension is randomized between a lower bound and upper bound.
  
#### Suggestions
I am completely open to suggestions as making datapacks is quite fun, feel free to ask. I'm pretty new though so I might not do everything great or even proper.

###### Contributors
Feel free to fork and submit a pull request for just about anything, if it's even somewhat in the same ballpark of what I was going for I will probably take it.
